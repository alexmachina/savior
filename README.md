# savior
Application's backup generator
It takes a db.json file at root with the following structure:
```
{
  "databases": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": "27017",
      "db": "mflores",
      "username": "mflores",
      "password": "cthulhu1",
    }
  ]
}

```

plus a private_key.json file, which is the one generated by google's developers console.
Savior will create, tar and compress the mongodb dump and send it to google drive. It is smart enough
to keep track of already sent files and update them instead of creating another one. To access the 
backup files, after it has been sent, check out db.json and look for a property Link in the db's section.
